= ScreenWidgetComponent

ScreenWidgetComponent is a very performant replacement for screen-space Unreal Engine WidgetComponent.

Supports Unreal Engine 4.27 and newer.

== What's wrong with WidgetComponent?

. It uses expensive `SConstraintCanvas` internally instead of a cheaper `SCanvas`
. It uses direct `float` Z-depth, resulting in unnecessary Z-order updates.
. It reorders its children in O(n^2^) time almost every frame, leading to multi-millisecond CPU losses on **ChildOrder** invalidation.

== Can optimizations this widget uses be applied to WidgetComponent?

Definitely yes.
